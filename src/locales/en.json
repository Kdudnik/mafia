Finally, the Doctor wakes up to try to save the player who they believe will be targeted by the mafia. After the Doctor goes back to sleep, the day begins, and the town wakes up."

If two or more players receive an equal number of votes, they have the right to another speech before a re-vote, where votes can only be cast for those who just spoke. This process can repeat until only two nominated players remain. After they give their final speeches, a final vote takes place.
